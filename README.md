UBports Foundation has picked up the Ubuntu Touch project with major visual/marketing design mistakes that prevailed from the brand to raise for greatness. 

"Attract what you expect, reflect what you desire, become what you respect, mirror what you admire." 

The following materials, visuals, and UI kits work were made to improve with the brand and to give it a fair chance against other players.

With that said, I ask you kindly don't mix these crafts with miss-match designs. Follow the rules that were given. That design was provided to improve with standards of the Ubuntu Touch brand. 

Just ask for help
If you need additional visuals.
If you need help with implementing these designs.

With the power of good design, you will achieve the things you desire.
